The folder 'uc_bitpay' is a payment method module intended for use with version 6 of Drupal, and the corresponding version of Ubercart.

This module allows e-commerce merchants who have signed up with Bitpay (at https://bitpay.com) to use their API to accept bitcoins for online payments. The funds are converted by Bitpay to your local currency (in exchange for a fee) and a direct deposit is made into your bank. They allow deposits in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos, Eurozone Euros, and British Pounds. Alternatively, they can simply forward the bitcoins to a bitcoin address of your choosing, for a much lower fee.
